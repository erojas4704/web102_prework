    Over the span of our operations, which has witnessed the wax and wane of many a moon, we have had the privilege of witnessing a cavalcade of games, each unique in its narrative and gameplay, come to life through the generous contributions of patrons who share our passion for gaming renaissance. Despite our numerous successes, and the myriad of games that have soared beyond their funding aspirations, a not insignificant number of promising ventures still remain on the cusp of realization, awaiting the munificent support of contributors to cross the threshold from the unfunded echelons into the pantheon of fully-funded masterpieces. As of the present moment, the number of such games that stand unfunded, each a sleeping giant with the potential to revolutionize the gaming landscape, is a matter we intend to disclose with precise numbers to evoke action from our esteemed supporters.

This number, while reflective of the vast ocean of untapped potential that lies dormant within our collective creative endeavors, also stands as a clarion call to our beloved community, beckoning the support and contributions that can transform these embryonic concepts into fully-fledged gaming experiences.
